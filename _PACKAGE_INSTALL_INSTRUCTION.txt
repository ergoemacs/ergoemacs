This is the installation instruction for the ErgoEmacs Package.

The ErgoEmacs Package is a set of elisp files that can be installed on any platform running emacs. (e.g. Mac OS X, Linux, Windows)

The home page of ErgoEmacs is at http://ErgoEmacs.org/

--------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

You need to have working emacs already installed on your system.
(For Mac, we recommend Carbon Emacs at http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html)

1. Unzip the package.

 (if you have not done so already.) 
 Example:

 unzip ergoemacs_1.6.2.zip

2. Compile the elisp files.

 You can do so by opening the file
 “ergoemacs_1.6.2/build-util/byte-compile_lisp_files.el”
 then type Alt+x, then eval-buffer.

 It may take 30 seconds. Ignore the output of warnings.

3. Put the package in your emacs library dir.

 Create a directory “~/my_emacs_lib/”
 (this can be any dir you use for personal emacs libraries)

 Move ergoemacs dir into the “~/my_emacs_lib/” directory.
 So, you should have
 “~/my_emacs_lib/ergoemacs_1.6.2/”

4. In your “~/.emacs”, put the following lines:

(load "~/my_emacs_lib/ergoemacs_1.6.2/site-lisp/site-start.el")
