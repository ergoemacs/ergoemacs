* Introduction

This is the installation instruction for the ErgoEmacs Package.

The ErgoEmacs Package is a set of elisp files that can be installed on any platform running emacs. (Mac OS X, Linux, Windows) Once installed, you'll have a enhanced version of emacs, with ergonomic keybindings, enhance user interface, and many elisp packages prepared and loaded for you.

The home page of ErgoEmacs is at http://ErgoEmacs.org/

* Requirement

You need to have a working emacs already installed.

Your emacs should be version 23.2 or later. (To find out what is the version of your emacs, type in emacs “M-x version”.)

** Mac

For Mac, you can download emacs 23.x at
http://emacsformacosx.com/

If you are using Carbon Emacs ( http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html ), as of 2010-06-12, it is not based on emacs 23.2.

If you are using Aquamacs Emacs ( http://aquamacs.org/ ), the latest version on the website should work.

* Installation

** 1. Unzip the package.
 Example:

 unzip ergoemacs_1.7.1.zip

 (The version number is just a example. Yours may be higher.)

** 2. Put the package in your emacs library dir.

 Move ergoemacs folder into the directory at “~/.emacs.d/”

 So, you should have
 “~/.emacs.d/ergoemacs_1.7.1/”

 If the directory “~/.emacs.d/” does not exist, creat it.

** 3. In your “~/.emacs”, put the following lines:

; Optional
; (setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "dv") ; for Dvorak keyboard

; Optional. Swap “Ctrl+x” and “Ctrl+t”, so it's easier to type on Dvorak layout
; (keyboard-translate ?\C-t ?\C-x) (keyboard-translate ?\C-x ?\C-t)

; Options for Mac.
; (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
; (setq mac-option-modifier 'hyper)

(load-file "~/.emacs.d/ergoemacs_1.7.1/site-lisp/site-start.el")

* Using Different Keyboard Layout (optional)

Place ONE of the following line in your emacs init file (~/.emacs):

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "us") ; US layout
(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "dv") ; US Dvorak layout
(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "gb") ; UK layout
(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "gb-dv") ; UK Dvorak layout
(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "sp") ; Spanish (Spain) (aka “Spanish (International sort)”)
(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "it") ; Italian layout
(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "colemak") ; Colemak layout

It should be placed before you load the site-start.el file.
