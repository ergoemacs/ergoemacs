This is the installation instruction for the ErgoEmacs Package.

The ErgoEmacs Package is a set of elisp files that can be installed on any platform running emacs. (e.g. Mac OS X, Linux, Windows) Once installed, you'll have a enhanced version of emacs, with ergonomic keybindings, enhance user interface, and many elisp packages prepared and loaded for you.

The home page of ErgoEmacs is at http://ErgoEmacs.org/

--------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENT

You need to have working emacs already installed on your system.
(For Mac, we recommend Carbon Emacs at http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html)

Your emacs should be version 23.x. (To find out, type in shell: “emacs --version”, or in emacs type “M-x version”.)

--------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

1. Unzip the package.

 (if you have not done so already.) 
 Example:

 unzip ergoemacs_1.6.2.zip

 (The version number is just a example. Your may be higher.)

2. Put the package in your emacs library dir.

 Create a directory “~/my_emacs_lib/”
 (this can be any dir you use for personal emacs libraries)

 Move ergoemacs dir into the “~/my_emacs_lib/” directory.
 So, you should have
 “~/my_emacs_lib/ergoemacs_1.6.2/”

3. In your “~/.emacs”, put the following lines:

; (setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "dv") ; optional for Dvorak keyboard
(load-file "~/my_emacs_lib/ergoemacs_1.6.2/site-lisp/site-start.el")

--------------------------------------------------
USING DIFFERENT KEYBOARD LAYOUT

If you are using Dvorak keyboard layout, put the line:

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "dv")

before you load the site-start.el file.

You can also set a environment variable in your operating system.

The variable name should be: “ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT”

The value can be any one of:

 Value        Meaning
