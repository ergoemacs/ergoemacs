;;; DESCRIPTION

;; this package is some misc emacs lisp utility.
;; It provides the following functions:

;; unit-at-cursor
;; get-selection-or-unit
;; get-image-dimensions
;; get-image-dimensions-imk
;; get-string-from-file
;; read-lines
;; get-html-file-title
;; trim-string
;; asciify-text
;; title-case-string-region-or-line

;; The most used two are “unit-at-cursor” and “get-selection-or-unit”. They are intended as improvemnt of “thing-at-point”. For detailed discussion, see:〈Emacs Lisp: get-selection-or-unit〉 @ http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp_get-selection-or-unit.html

;; This package requires 〔xfrp_find_replace_pairs.el〕, available at 
;; http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/browse/trunk/packages/xfrp_find_replace_pairs.el

;;; INSTALL

;; Place the file in your emacs load path. Then
;; (require 'xfrp_find_replace_pairs)
;; (require 'xeu_elisp_util)

;;; HISTORY

;; version 1.4.6, 2011-11-18 Added a “title-case-string-region-or-line”.
;; version 1.4.5, 2011-11-14 corrected a critical error in “asciify-text”.
;; version 1.4.4, 2011-11-14 added function “asciify-text”.
;; version 1.4.3, 2011-11-06 unit-at-cursor with 「'block」 argument will work when the text block is at beginning/end of buffer. Also, lines with just space or tab is also considered a empty line.
;; version 1.4.2, 2011-10-30 trivial implementation change on “get-html-file-title”. No user visible effect.
;; version 1.4.1, 2011-09-29 fixed a error in “trim-string”.
;; version 1.4, 2011-09-16 added “trim-string”.
;; version 1.3, 2011-08-27 fixed a bug in “unit-at-cursor” when argument is 「'block」. Now it doesn't grab a extra line ending.
;; version 1.2, 2011-07-02 inline doc improvement for “get-image-dimensions” “get-image-dimensions-imk”.
;; version 1.1, 2011-05-28 Added some comment in source code.
;; version 1.0, 2011-03-02 First version.


;;; Code:

(defun unit-at-cursor (unit)
  "Return the string and boundary of UNIT under cursor.

Returns a vector [text a b], where text is the string and a and b are its boundary.

UNIT can be:

• 'word — sequence of 0 to 9, A to Z, a to z, and hyphen.

• 'glyphs — sequence of visible glyphs. Useful for file name, URL, …, anything doesn't have white spaces in it.

• 'line — delimited by “\\n”. (captured text does not include a ending “\\n”.)

• 'block — delimited by empty lines or beginning/end of buffer. Lines with just spaces or tabs are also considered empty line. (captured text does not include a ending “\\n”.)

• 'buffer — whole buffer. (respects `narrow-to-region')

• a vector [beginRegex endRegex] — The elements are regex strings used to determine the beginning/end of boundary chars. They are passed to `skip-chars-backward' and `skip-chars-forward'. For example, if you want paren as delimiter, use [\"^(\" \"^)\"]

Example usage:
 (setq bds (unit-at-cursor 'line))
 (setq inputstr (elt bds 0) p1 (elt bds 1) p2 (elt bds 2)  )

This function is similar to `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.
The main differences are:

• This function returns the text and the 2 boundaries as a vector in one shot.

• 'line always returns the line without end of line character, avoiding inconsistency when the line is at end of buffer.

• This function's behavior does not depend on syntax table. e.g. for units 「'word」, 「'block」, etc."
