<p>By Washington Irving, 1824</p>

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">French Revolution</b>→ The French Revolution (1789 〜 1799) was a period of political and social upheaval in the history of France, during which the French governmental structure, previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution">French Revolution</a></div>

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">Swedenborg</b>→ Emanuel Swedenborg (1688 〜 1772), Swedish scientist, philosopher, Christian mystic, theologian. Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At the age of fifty-six he entered into a spiritual phase, in which he experienced dreams and visions, where he claimed he was appointed by the Lord to write a heavenly doctrine to reform Christianity. For the remaining 28 years of his life, he wrote and published 18 theological works, of which the best known was Heaven and Hell (1758).

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">perdition</b>→ Loss of the soul; eternal damnation; hell.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perdition">perdition</a></div>

<p>Gottfried Wolfgang was a young man of good family. He had studied
for some time at <span class="xnt">Göttingen</span>, but being of a visionary and enthusiastic
character, he had wandered into those wild and speculative doctrines
which have so often bewildered German students. His secluded life, his
intense application, and the singular nature of his studies, had an
effect on both mind and body. His health was impaired; his imagination
diseased. He had been indulging in fanciful speculations on spiritual
essences, until, like <span class="xnt">Swedenborg</span>, he had an ideal world of his own
around him. He took up a notion, I do not know from what cause, that
there was an evil influence hanging over him; an evil genius or spirit
seeking to ensnare him and ensure his <span class="xnt">perdition</span>. Such an idea working
on his <b class="w">melancholy</b> temperament produced the most gloomy effects. He
became <b class="w">haggard</b> and <b class="w">desponding</b>. His friends discovered the mental
<b class="w">malady</b> <b class="w">preying</b> upon him, and determined that the best cure was a
change of scene; he was sent, therefore, to finish his studies amidst
the splendors and <b class="w">gayeties</b> of Paris.</p>

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">Sorbonne</b>→ 
Refers to Collège de Sorbonne, Founded in 1257, located in Paris, France. A intellectual center of France.

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">catacombs</b>→ A cave, grotto, or subterraneous place of large extent used for the burial of the dead.</div>

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">charnel-house</b>→ A building, room, or vault in which the bones or bodies of the dead are placed; a charnel. (AHD)</div>

<p>Wolfgang arrived at Paris at the breaking out of the
revolution. The popular <b class="w">delirium</b> at first caught his enthusiastic
mind, and he was captivated by the political and philosophical
theories of the day: but the scenes of blood which followed shocked
his sensitive nature, disgusted him with society and the world, and
made him more than ever a recluse. He shut himself up in a solitary
apartment in the <b class="w">Pays Latin</b>, the quarter of students. There, in a
gloomy street not far from the monastic walls of the <span class="xnt">Sorbonne</span>, he
pursued his favorite speculations. Sometimes he spend hours together
in the great libraries of Paris, those <span class="xnt">catacombs</span> of departed authors,
<b class="w">rummaging</b> among their <b class="w">hoards</b> of dusty and obsolete works in quest of
food for his unhealthy appetite. He was, in a manner, a literary
ghoul, feeding in the <span class="xnt">charnel-house</span> of decayed literature.</p>

<p>Wolfgang, though solitary and <b class="w">recluse</b>, was of an ardent temperament, but for a time it operated merely upon his imagination. He was too shy and ignorant of the world to make any advances to the fair, but he was a passionate admirer of female beauty, and in his lonely chamber would often lose himself in <b class="w">reveries</b> on forms and faces which he had seen, and his fancy would deck out images of loveliness far surpassing the reality.</p>

<p>While his mind was in this excited
and <b class="w">sublimated</b> state, a dream produced an
extraordinary effect upon him. It was of a female face of transcendent
beauty. So strong was the impression made, that he dreamt of it again
and again. It haunted his thoughts by day, his slumbers by night; in
fine, he became passionately enamored of this shadow of a dream. This
lasted so long that it became one of those fixed ideas which haunt the
minds of melancholy men, and are at times mistaken for madness.</p>


<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">Marais</b>→ Le Marais is a district in Paris, France, traditionally a bourgeois area, but also well-known historically.

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">Place de Graève</b>→ A plaza now called the City Hall Plaza (place de l'Hôtel de Ville). Place de Grève was the site of most executions in Paris. The gallows and the pillory stood there.

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">guillotine</b>→ A machine to cut people's head off. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guillotine">guillotine</a></div>

<p>Such was Gottfried Wolfgang, and such his situation at the time I
mentioned. He was returning home late on stormy night, through some of
the old and gloomy streets of the <span class="xnt">Marais</span>, the ancient part of
Paris. The loud claps of thunder rattled among the high houses of the
narrow streets. He came to the <span class="xnt">Place de Graève</span>, the square, where
public executions are performed. The lightning quivered about the
pinnacles of the ancient <span class="xnt">Hôtel de Ville</span>, and shed flickering gleams
over the open space in front. As Wolfgang was crossing the square, he
shrank back with horror at finding himself close by the <span class="xnt">guillotine</span>. It
was the height of the reign of terror, when this dreadful instrument
of death stood ever ready, and its scaffold was continually running
with the blood of the virtuous and the brave. It had that very day
been actively employed in the work of carnage, and there it stood in
grim array, amidst a silent and sleeping city, waiting for fresh
victims.</p>

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">vicissitude</b>→ Regular change or succession from one thing to another; Irregular change; revolution; mutation.</div>

<p>Wolfgang's heart sickened within him, and he was turning shuddering
from the horrible engine, when he beheld a shadowy form, <b class="w">cowering</b> as
it were at the foot of the steps which led up to the scaffold. A
succession of vivid flashes of lightning revealed it more
distinctly. It was a female figure, dressed in black. She was seated
on one of the lower steps of the scaffold, leaning forward, her face
hid in her lap; and her long <b class="w">dishevelled</b> <b class="w">tresses</b> hanging to the
ground, streaming with the rain which fell in <b class="w">torrents</b>. Wolfgang
paused. There was something awful in this solitary monument of
woe. The female had the appearance of being above the common order. He
knew the times to be full of <span class="xnt">vicissitude</span>, and that many a fair head,
which had once been pillowed on down, now wandered houseless. Perhaps
this was some poor mourner whom the dreadful axe had rendered
desolate, and who sat here heart-broken on the strand of existence,
from which all that was dear to her had been launched into
eternity.</p>

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">ravishingly</b>→ in a ravishing manner; To seize and carry away by violence; to snatch by force.</div>

<p>He approached, and addressed her in the accents of sympathy. She
raised her head and gazed wildly at him. What was his astonishment at
beholding, by the bright glare of the lighting, the very face which
had haunted him in his dreams. It was pale and <b class="w">disconsolate</b>, but
<span class="xnt">ravishingly</span> beautiful.</p>

<p>Trembling with violent and conflicting emotions, Wolfgang again
accosted her. He spoke something of her being exposed at such an hour
of the night, and to the fury of such a storm, and offered to conduct
her to her friends. She pointed to the guillotine with a gesture of
dreadful signification.</p>

<p>“I have no friend on earth!” said she.</p>

<p>“but you have a home,” said Wolfgang.</p>

<p>“Yes—in the grave!”</p>

<p>The heart of the student melted at the words.</p>

<p>“If a stranger dare make an offer,” said he, “without danger of
being misunderstood, I would offer my humble dwelling as a shelter;
myself as a devoted friend. I am friendless myself in Paris, and a
stranger in the land; but if my life could be of service, it is at
your disposal, and should be sacrificed before harm or indignity
should come to you.”</p>

<p>There was an honest earnestness in the young man's manner that had
its effect. His foreign accent, too, was in his favor; it showed him
not to be a hackneyed inhabitant of Paris. Indeed, there is an
eloquence in true enthusiasm that is not to be doubted. The homeless
stranger confided herself implicitly to the protection of the
student.</p>

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">Pont Neuf</b>→ The Pont Neuf, French for the “New Bridge,” is the oldest standing bridge across the river Seine in Paris.

<div class="xnote"><b class="x3nt">Henry the Fourth</b>→ Henry IV (1553 〜 1610), ruled as King of France from 1589 to 1610. A major figure in French history. His stature on Pont Neuf bridge was built in 1614, 4 years after his assassination, and destroyed during the French revolution, but rebuilt in 1818 and still stands today.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France">Henry the Fourth</a></div>

<p>He supported her faltering steps across the <span class="xnt">Pont Neuf</span>,
and by the place where the statue of <span class="xnt">Henry the Fourth</span> had been
overthrown by the populace. The storm had abated, and the thunder
rumbled at a distance. All Paris was quiet; that great volcano of
human passion slumbered for a while, to gather fresh strength for the
next day's eruption. The student conducted his charge through the
ancient streets of the Pays Latin, and by the dusky walls of the
Sorbonne, to the great <b class="w">dingy</b> hotel which he inhabited. The old
portress who admitted them stared with surprise at the unusual sight
of the melancholy Wolfgang, with a female companion.</p>

<p>On entering his apartment, the student, for the first time, blushed
at the scantiness and indifference of his dwelling. He had but one
chamber—an old-fashioned saloon—heavily carved, and fantastically
furnished with the remains of former magnificence, for it was one of
those hotels in the quarter nobility. It was lumbered with books and
papers, and all the usual apparatus of a student, and his bed stood in
a recess at one end.</p>

<p>When lights were brought, and Wolfgang had a better opportunity of
contemplating the stranger, he was more than ever intoxicated by her
beauty. Her face was pale, but of a dazzling fairness, set off by a
profusion of raven hair that hung clustering about it. Her eyes were
large and brilliant, with a singular expression approaching almost to
wildness. As far as her black dress permitted her shape to be seen, it
was of perfect symmetry. Her whole appearance was highly striking,
though she was dressed in the simplest style. The only thing
approaching to an ornament which she wore, was a broad black band
round her neck, clasped by diamonds.</p>

<p>The perplexity now commenced with the student how to dispose of the
helpless being thus thrown upon his protection. He thought of
abandoning his chamber to her, and seeking shelter for himself
elsewhere. Still he was so fascinate by her charms, there seemed to be
such a spell upon his thoughts and senses, that he could not tear
himself from her presence. Her manner, too, was singular and
unaccountable. She spoke no more of the guillotine. Her grief had
abated. The attentions of the student had first won her confidence,
and then, apparently, her heart. She was evidently an enthusiast like
himself, and enthusiasts soon understand each other.</p>

<p>In the infatuation of the moment, Wolfgang avowed his passion for
her. He told her the story of his mysterious dream, and how she had
possessed his heart before he had even seen her. She was strangely
affected by his recital, and acknowledge to have felt an impulse
towards him equally unaccountable. It was the time for wild theory and
wild actions. Old prejudices and superstitions were done away;
everything was under the sway of the “Goddess of Reason.” Among other
rubbish of the old times, the forms and ceremonies of marriage began
to be considered superfluous bonds for honorable minds. Social compact
were the vogue. Wolfgang was too much of theorist not to be tainted by
the liberal doctrines of the day.</p>

<p>“Why should we separate?” said he: “our heart are united; in the
eye of reason and honor we are as one. What need is there of <b class="w">sordid</b>
forms to bind high soul together?”</p>

<p>The stranger listened with emotion: she had evidently received
illumination at the same school.</p>

<p>“You have no home nor family,” continued he: “Let me be everything
to you, or rather let us be everything to one another. if form is
necessary, form shall be observed — there is my hand. I pledge myself
to you forever.”</p>

<p>“Forever?” said the stranger, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Forever!” repeated Wolfgang.</p>

<p>The stranger clasped the hand extended to her: “Then I am yours,”
murmured she, and sank upon his bosom.</p>

<p>The next morning the student left his bride sleeping, and sallied
forth at an early hour to seek more spacious apartments suitable to
the change in his situation. When he returned, he found the stranger
lying with her head hanging over the bed, and one arm thrown over
it. He spoke to her, but received no reply. He advanced to awaken her
from her uneasy posture. On taking her hand, it was cold—there was no
pulsation—her face was pallid and ghastly. In a word, she was a
corpse.</p>

<p>Horrified and frantic, he alarmed the house. A scene of confusion
ensued. The police was summoned. As the officer of police entered the
room, he started back on beholding the corpse.</p>

<p>“Great heaven!” cried he, “how did this woman come here?”</p>

<p>“do you know anything about her?” said Wolfgang eagerly.</p>

<p>“Do I?” exclaimed the officer: “she was guillotined yesterday.”</p>

<p>He stepped forward; undid the black collar round the neck of the
corpse, and the head rolled on the floor!</p>

<p>The student burst into a frenzy. “The fiend! the fiend has gained
possession of me!” shrieked he; “I am lost forever.”</p>

<p>They tried to soothe him, but in vain. He was possessed with the
frightful belief that an evil spirit had reanimated the dead body to
ensnare him. He went distracted, and died in a mad-house.</p>

<p>Here the old gentleman with the haunted head finished his narrative.</p>

<p>“And is this really a fact?” said the inquisitive gentleman.</p>

<p>“A fact not to be doubted,” replied the other. “I had it it from
the best authority. The student told it me himself. I saw him in a
mad-house in Paris.”
