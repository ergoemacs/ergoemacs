For detail of this project, see: http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/

This is very much alpha and experimental.
No major structure has been set yet.
However, things included here should all work. Namely, it will not break emacs.

For installation, see the file _INSTALL.txt

For version history, and what features are added, see: _VERSION_HISTORY.txt
