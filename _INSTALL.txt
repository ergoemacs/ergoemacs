INSTALL

You need emacs 23, released in 2009-07-30.

For locations to download Windows and Mac binaries, see:
http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs_basics.html

• Unpack “ErgoEmacs_v1.4.4.zip”. (if not already done so)
• Open the file “init.el” in emacs.
• Type “Alt+x eval-buffer”.

That's it.

If you want emacs to load it automatically on start, put the following lines in your emacs init file at “$HOME/.emacs”:

;; add the path the load path emacs searchs.
(add-to-list 'load-path "/Users/mary/ErgoEmacs")  ; make sure the path is correct

;; load the init file.
(load-file "/Users/mary/ErgoEmacs/init.el")

If you are using a dvorak keyboard, open the file init.el and uncomment the line “(load "ergonomic_keybinding_dvorak")” and comment out the qwerty one.
