;; the reason for these aliases is that, often, elisp package names is
;; not intuitive, and should not be the lang name neither. For
;; example, for javascript, those familiar with emacs would intuitive
;; type M-x javascript-mode or M-x js-mode. However, the 2 most robust
;; js packages are called by M-x espresso-mode and M-x
;; js2-mode. Without some insider knowledge, it is difficult to know
;; what function user needs to call for particular major mode he wants.
;; (the mode menu in ErgoEmacs helps, but this is not in GNU Emacs 23)

;; also, due to elisp not having name space, or a enforced
;; package/module/lib naming system etc, package names shouldn't be
;; just the language name. That is, a particular javascript mode
;; really shouldn't be named javascript-mode, because, different
;; people's packages for js will all compete for that name, and
;; prevents the flexibility of testing or using different versions of
;; major mode for that language. Given the way things are, one ideal
;; fix is to always use a alias to point to the mode where ErgoEmacs
;; decides to be the default for that lang. For example, ErgoEmacs
;; bundles 2 major modes for javascript, js2-mode and espresso-mode,
;; and suppose we decided espresso-mode should be the default, then we
;; can define a alias js-mode to point to espresso-mode. This way,
;; user can intuitively load the package for js, but can also load a
;; different one if he has knowledege about which modes exists for the
;; lang he wants.

;; 2010-06-03 espresso-mode is now js-mode, part of GNU emacs 23.2. It is removed from ErgoEmacs.
