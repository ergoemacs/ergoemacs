This file is a version history for developers.

A Release Notes for users can be based on this file.

The ideas is that developers can write down what largish changes are made between releases here. The writing is more oriented for developers with tech detail, and no worry about representation. All non-trivial changes can be written down here.

Then, when we have a new release, we can write a Release Notes for the users, using info in this file as basis.

This is just a idea how version history and release notes can be done... open to suggestions or may change depending how things works out. For example, possibly the Google Code's wiki can be used instead of this file. 

This file is now based on the svn log commit history.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/updates/list
or svn command 「svn log」.

*** Erlang
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29

Erlang's file name extension is “.erl”.

you might need to put the following with the right path in your emacs init file.
(setq erlang-root-dir "C:/Program Files (x86)/erl5.8.1.1")

* Version 1.7: 2010-01-28.

Major user visible changes:

** New Modes

• Added lua-mode.el for editing the lua language source code.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=340

 • Added a dos.el and batch-mode.el modes (for editing Windows's command line batch script.) This can be access from the menu File -> Language Modes.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=307
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=55#c0

 • There is now a menu for loading a javascript mode (the expresso-mode).
 http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=311

• A new mode for editing bbcode is included. (command name is xbbcode-mode).
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=332

• Added a new mode for AutoHotKey. The new mode xahk-mode replaces the previous ahk-mode.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=24#c1

Most modes with unintuitive names now have a alias. For example, calling js-mode loads the expresso-mode designed for editing javascript. bbcode-mode calls xbbcode-mode, lsl-mode calls xlsl-mode, ahk-mode calls xahk-mode, etc.

** Menu Changes

• Added a submenu under File -> Language Modes -> List Text Editing Modes. This is intended to show all modes that are used for editing special files.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=64#c0

** Key shortcut changes

 • Now, Alt+n will cancel commands (GNU Emacs's Ctrl+g). Experimental.
 http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=313

 http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=32 .

  • thanks to David Capello for helping out, preparing SVN use, preparing to create a Windows binary with installer.

* Version 1.4.5: 2009-08-27.

  • Some re-organization of init files. The structure is still pretty alpha stage. (haven't spend much time on this really) The init.el is the start init file. It loads the other init files:

  ergonomic_keybinding_dvorak (or ergonomic_keybinding_qwerty)
  init_load_packages.el
  init_settings.el

  • ergoemacs keybinding set. See http://xahlee.org/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_keybinding.html The ergoemacs keybindings fixes several of emacs's problems:

  • Ergonomic editing keybindings. (fixes emacs RSI inducing pinky problem) Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs_kb_shortcuts_pain.html

  • compatible with standard keyboard shortcuts. e.g. Standard shortcuts for New, Open, Close, Save, Save As, Print, Select All. (fixes emacs's keyboard shortcut incompatibility with Windows, Mac, Linux)

  • The “New” (new-empty-buffer) command (shortcut Ctrl+n) will open a empty buffer titled “untitled”. (fixes emacs's problem of difficult to create a new buffer) Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_scratch_buffer.html

  • The new-empty-buffer can be called multiple times to create many scratch buffers. This fixes “*scratch*” buffer problem of single scratch.

  • Closing a buffer not associated with a file (such as invoking new-empty-buffer) will ask user to save. (This fixes a emacs problem where *scratch* or other buffer not associated with file will close without asking for save.)

  • Has commands to switch next/previous user buffer and next/previous macs buffer. With shortcuts. (This fixes emacs's problem of next-buffer that goes thru tens of emacs's “internal” buffers. i.e. buffer names starting with “*”)

  • Fixed emacs mark-word problem, with extend-selection command. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_mark-word.html

  • Fixed emacs's toggle letter case problem, with toggle-letter-case cammand. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_upcase-word.html

  • Fixed's the usability of emacs fill-paragraph related commands. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_fill-paragraph.html

  • Fixed emacs describe-mode usability. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_mode_doc.html

  • Fixed the ^L display problem so it displays a horizontal line instead.

  • Fixed Emacs's Menu Usability Problem. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_menu.html
