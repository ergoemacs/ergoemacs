HISTORY

* Version 1.9.?: ?

write any new update here

* Version 1.9.4: 2011-07-30

• Buffer names of files of the same name will now show the directory, for easy visual identification. (toggle-uniquify-buffer-names)

• “cperl-mode” is now default mode for perl code, instead of “perl-mode”.

• A complete revamped set of html templates for html-mode. (yasnippet; “yas/minor-mode”) The new set has templates for all HTML5 tags, and only HTML5 ones.

• “elisp-index-search” will default to the symbol under cursor.

• New function “toggle-whitespace-setting” 

• “keyfreq-mode” is now loaded by default, instead of “command-frequency”.

• New version of 〔xmsi-math-symbols-input.el〕. Call “xmsi-mode” for detail.

• Added a alias “math-symbol-input-mode” for “xmsi-mode”.

• The spec-mode and hunspell for spell checking has been in dev hell (or my laziness). Now they officially doesn't work. The default is just fly-spell with aspell.

• updated visual-basic-mode.el to v1.4.12

• xlsl-mode.el at version 1.6.1 (for Second Life LSL scripting.)

• when working with emacs lisp files (“.el”), it a byte-compile will be done automatically after a save, if the file already has a byte-compiled “.elc” version.

• new version of the elisp util 〔xfrp_find_replace_pairs.el〕 See: 〈Emacs Lisp: Multi-Pair String Replacement: xfrp_find_replace_pairs.el〉 @ http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp_replace_string_region.html

• removed abbrevs for emacs-lisp-mode that's only single letter. Because they often expand when you don't want to. Replaced them using 8 as prefix for now. (e.g. type “8m” for “message”)

* Version 1.9.3.1: 2011-05-28

A beta release of zipped ErgoEmacs elisp packages.

* Version 1.9.3: 2011-05-28.
** New version of the ergoemacs-mode minor mode, at v5.3.9
For detail, see: 〔ergoemacs/ergoemacs-keybindings/_HISTORY.txt〕
** new command: toggle-whitespace-setting for whitespace-mode (r656)
When you call whitespace-mode, spaces and tabs are shown with special glyphs. You can toggle 2 settings for how whitespaces are shown, by calling “toggle-whitespace-setting”.
** Caps Lock key for execute-extended-command
For Windows users, there's new AutoHotkey utility for making Caps Lock key do
emacs execute-extended-command.

Get it at: http://xahlee.org/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_keybinding_system-wide.html
** Windows system-wide ErgoEmacs keys for Nativo layout 
Get it at: http://xahlee.org/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_keybinding_system-wide.html

Thanks to Milan Santosi, Xavier Gomes Pinho.

You can get the AutoHotkey script source code at:
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fextra
** emacs's Info-mode, Backspace key = previous viewed page
In Info-mode, Backspace key goes to the previous viewed page.  Shift+Backspace moves forward. Similar to browsers in Windows and Mac.

(Info-mode is a mode to view emacs documentations. Type 【Ctrl+h i】 to view it. You can then use mouse to navigate.)
** new version of xmsi-mode for math symbols and unicode input
For read release history, call “describe-function”, then “xmsi-mode”, then click on the file name 〔xmsi-math-symbols-input.el〕, then scroll to file's top.
** New: keyfreq.el replaces command-frequencies.el
〔command-frequencies.el〕 no longer flood your “*Messages*” buffer when you start emacs. However, this package is now defunct. 

David Capello wrote keyfreq fresh, replacing 〔command-frequencies.el〕. The two are not compatible. The data files are not compatible, the commands and features, are also slightly different.

ErgoEmacs now loads keyfreq instead of command-frequencies.
*** Some tip about command-frequencies.el
The data file of “command-frequencies” is at 〔~/.emacs.d/.emacs.command.frequency〕.
To view your command frequency, call “command-frequency”.
The source file is at 〔ergoemacs/packages/command-frequency.el〕.
*** some tip about keyfreq.el
The data file is saved at 〔~/.emacs.d/.emacs.keyfreq〕.

Call “keyfreq-show” to see your command frequency.

To turn it on or off, call “keyfreq-mode”.

Here's a list of commands:
 keyfreq-mode
 keyfreq-show
 keyfreq-autosave-mode
 keyfreq-html
 keyfreq-json

The source code is at 〔ergoemacs/packages/keyfreq.el〕.
** Change: abbreviations in emacs-lisp-mode. (r657)
About 8 abbreviations in emacs-lisp-mode changed.

For example, before, when you type “i ”, it becomes “insert ”. There are about 8 such single letter abbreviations. The expansion is often annoying.

These are removed. To use them, you have to type “8” as a prefix. e.g. “8i ” becomes “insert ”. This is not perfect, but not sure what's better.

You can view the list of abbrevs at 〔ergoemacs/init_abbrevs-lisp-mode.el〕.

** Change: pretty print control L
The package 〔ergoemacs/packages/pp-c-l.el〕 for rendering the form feed character (^L) as a horizontal line is updated.

However, it is no longer loaded by default. The reason is that it interfere with settings of whitespace-mode.

Major user visible changes:

** New Modes

• Added lua-mode.el for editing the lua language source code.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=340

 • Added a dos.el and batch-mode.el modes (for editing Windows's command line batch script.) This can be access from the menu File -> Language Modes.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=307
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=55#c0

 • There is now a menu for loading a javascript mode (the expresso-mode).
 http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=311

• A new mode for editing bbcode is included. (command name is xbbcode-mode).
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=332

• Added a new mode for AutoHotKey. The new mode xahk-mode replaces the previous ahk-mode.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=24#c1

Most modes with unintuitive names now have a alias. For example, calling js-mode loads the expresso-mode designed for editing javascript. bbcode-mode calls xbbcode-mode, lsl-mode calls xlsl-mode, ahk-mode calls xahk-mode, etc.

** Menu Changes

• Added a submenu under File -> Language Modes -> List Text Editing Modes. This is intended to show all modes that are used for editing special files.
http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=64#c0

** Key shortcut changes

 • Now, Alt+n will cancel commands (GNU Emacs's Ctrl+g). Experimental.
 http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/detail?r=313

  • Changed loading of hunspell, so that if on non-Windows, it is not loaded. Issue 51 temp fix.
 
* Version 1.6.1: 2009-09-27.
  
* Version 1.6: 2009-09-25.

  • fixed the init load from loading the Dvorak to QWERTY. (am dvorak user, was too lazy to make it default qwerty before as it should.)
  • thanks to David Capello for helping out, preparing SVN use, preparing to create a Windows binary with installer.

* Version 1.4.5: 2009-08-27.

  • Some re-organization of init files. The structure is still pretty alpha stage. (haven't spend much time on this really) The init.el is the start init file. It loads the other init files:

  ergonomic_keybinding_dvorak (or ergonomic_keybinding_qwerty)
  init_load_packages.el
  init_settings.el
  init_clean_menus.el

  next todo is to move all packages into one single dir. So the top level dir is clean.

  • ergoemacs keybinding set. See http://xahlee.org/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_keybinding.html The ergoemacs keybindings fixes several of emacs's problems:

  • Ergonomic editing keybindings. (fixes emacs RSI inducing pinky problem) Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/emacs_kb_shortcuts_pain.html

  • compatible with standard keyboard shortcuts. e.g. Standard shortcuts for New, Open, Close, Save, Save As, Print, Select All. (fixes emacs's keyboard shortcut incompatibility with Windows, Mac, Linux)

  • The “New” (new-empty-buffer) command (shortcut Ctrl+n) will open a empty buffer titled “untitled”. (fixes emacs's problem of difficult to create a new buffer) Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_scratch_buffer.html

  • The new-empty-buffer can be called multiple times to create many scratch buffers. This fixes “*scratch*” buffer problem of single scratch.

  • Closing a buffer not associated with a file (such as invoking new-empty-buffer) will ask user to save. (This fixes a emacs problem where *scratch* or other buffer not associated with file will close without asking for save.)

  • Has commands to switch next/previous user buffer and next/previous macs buffer. With shortcuts. (This fixes emacs's problem of next-buffer that goes thru tens of emacs's “internal” buffers. i.e. buffer names starting with “*”)

  • Fixed emacs mark-word problem, with extend-selection command. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_mark-word.html

  • Fixed emacs's toggle letter case problem, with toggle-letter-case cammand. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_upcase-word.html

  • Fixed's the usability of emacs fill-paragraph related commands. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_fill-paragraph.html

  • Fixed emacs describe-mode usability. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_mode_doc.html

  • Fixed the ^L display problem so it displays a horizontal line instead.

  • Fixed Emacs's Menu Usability Problem. Rationale: http://xahlee.org/emacs/modernization_menu.html
